## Explantion of the SHA512 Algorithm

## Answers
### Why can't we reverse the SHA512 algorithm to retrieve the original message from a hash digest?

### Can you design an algorithm that, given enough time, will find input messages that give each of the possible 512-bit strings?

### How difficult is it to find a hash digest beginning with at least twelve zeros?
